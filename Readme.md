# Excel-Projects

Welcome to my **Excel Projects** repository!  

This folder contains a collection of **Excel-based projects** that I have created as part of my journey in **data analytics**. Each project is designed to improve my skills in:

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation** – Ensuring datasets are analysis-ready.  
- **Formulas & Functions** – Using Excel functions to perform calculations.  
- **Pivot Tables & Charts** – Summarizing and visualizing data.  
- **Dashboards & Reporting** – Creating interactive and insightful reports.  
- **Problem Solving** – Applying Excel tools to real-world scenarios.  

## Projects

Each project is organized in its own subfolder with:

- **Excel files (.xlsx)** – Raw data and analysis workbooks  
- **Supporting documentation** (if any)  

## Purpose

The goal of these projects is to:

- Develop a strong foundation in Excel for analytics  
- Apply concepts to real datasets  
- Build a portfolio demonstrating practical Excel skills
